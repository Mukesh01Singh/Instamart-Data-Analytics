# ðŸ“Š Instamart Data Analytics

Welcome to the **Instamart Data Analytics** project! This project uses **SQL** to clean, explore, and analyze grocery order data from Instamart. The insights generated here help businesses optimize inventory, understand customer behavior, and make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

In today's fast-paced grocery delivery ecosystem, platforms like Instamart need to process large datasets efficiently to track sales trends, customer preferences, and outlet performance. This project focuses on:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling inconsistent entries in product details.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Summarizing sales, ratings, and orders.
- **Sales Analysis**: Exploring sales across products, outlets, and regions.
- **Pivot Analysis**: Comparing sales between categories like Low Fat and Regular items.

The goal is to extract actionable insights using SQL queries that are efficient, scalable, and easy to understand.

## ðŸ“‚ Technologies Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** â€“ for writing and executing SQL scripts
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** â€“ for data manipulation and analysis
- **GitHub** â€“ for version control and collaboration

## ðŸ“œ SQL Code Example

Hereâ€™s a snippet from the project showing how data cleaning is performed:

```sql
-- Clean inconsistent entries in Item_Fat_Content column
UPDATE Instamart_Data
SET Item_Fat_Content = 
    CASE
        WHEN LOWER(Item_Fat_Content) IN ('lf', 'low fat') THEN 'Low Fat'
        WHEN LOWER(Item_Fat_Content) = 'reg' THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE Item_Fat_Content
    END;

-- Verify that the values have been standardized
SELECT DISTINCT Item_Fat_Content FROM Instamart_Data;
